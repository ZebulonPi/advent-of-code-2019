# Advent of Code 2019

This will be the eventual home of my "Advent of Code" solutions for 2019.

Unlike last year, where I went with Python for my language of choice, this year I'm going with C#. I was going to go with Rust, but came into the language too late to really be able to not have it be a barrier to entry.
